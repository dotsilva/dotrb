An opinionated Omarchy theme featuring Ruby language references in backgrounds and color and heavily inspired in the ashen theme (neovim)

# Featuring:
Left side waybar [thanks to adsovetzky](https://github.com/adsovetzky/Adsovetzky-Omarchy-s-Waybar);

1 to border size and 1 to gaps in, just the minimal to help differentiate the windows! We want every pixel of the screen;

Red, light red, light pink, dark gray and light gray color palette;

Also thanks to [tahayvr](https://github.com/tahayvr/omarchist), whom made possible for me to easily make this theme through his awesome Omarchist app;
